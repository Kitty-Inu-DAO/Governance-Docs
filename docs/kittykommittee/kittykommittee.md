    > I've been in crypto since 2010, I mined and then bought Bitcoin early. I was in the original BTC discussion forum. I also participated in the ethereum and cardano ICOs. Prior to that I built and was CEO of a global company covering 6 sectors. I sold that to a VC 15 years ago. I used to run support groups in crpyto for thousands of people to help everyday. I would look for good projects daily and Kitty came up on the radar as part of that. Desi was a member of one of my groups back then too. I now travel the world, moving between living in Asia, Europe and the Americas

    > I have been on and off in crypto since 2017 with seriously only getting into it in 2020. Over my 25 years career, I have served in leadership roles in R&D (research and development) in the biotech industry, having worked with multiple companies that are either established or in the start up space. I have been in $Kitty since late Nov 2021.

    >My vision for the Kitty Inu DAO is to see it flourish as a non-profit that promotes charity and educational work across the globe using entertainment approaches. I believe the Meme character association combined with the Metaverse and Web3 gaming along with the possibility of a collaboration with 9vrse and using their Kitty Inu character can set the DAO to be successful in achieving these goals while enabling utility for the Kitty Inu token.

    > I have been in crypto since 2019 and still have a lot to learn! I’ve followed Kitty Inu from the start after hearing about the project through one of Adrian’s telegram groups. I have a lot of confidence in the team and have been impressed with the progress and commitment to date. I’m a lawyer by trade with a side focus on crypto regulation and I feel I’d be able to bring some of these skills to help out the Dao committee. I’m looking forward to the journey.

    >I've been investing in crypto since 2019 and came across Kitty Inu in Jan '21.  I've since spent much of my free time getting to know the community, the 9vrse Team and the projects they’re developing.  As a result I’m dedicated to seeing all of these elements grow.

    >I see the Kitty Inu Dao as a source to combine the talents, energy and ideas of it’s holders.  The potential for growth is all there, and in collaboration with the 9vrse, it will be exciting to see the direction we evolve.
